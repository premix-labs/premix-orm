# Introduction

Premix ORM is a zero-overhead, type-safe ORM for Rust. It generates SQL at
compile time via procedural macros, while keeping the runtime path as close
as possible to raw `sqlx` calls.

This book focuses on:

- How to model data and generate schemas.
- How to query and load relations.
- How to use migrations and transactions.
- What is supported today and what is not.

If you only need a quick start, see the next chapter. For API surface details,
use the rustdoc pages generated by `cargo doc`.
