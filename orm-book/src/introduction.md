# Introduction

Premix ORM is a zero-overhead, type-safe ORM for Rust. Its macros generate
query-building code at compile time, and the SQL strings are assembled at
runtime as close to raw `sqlx` calls as possible.

> Research status: This project is a research prototype. APIs may change and production use is not recommended yet.

This book focuses on:

- How to model data and generate schemas.
- How to query and load relations.
- How to use migrations and transactions.
- What is supported today and what is not.

If you only need a quick start, see the next chapter. For API surface details,
use the rustdoc pages generated by `cargo doc`.
