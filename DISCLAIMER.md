# Disclaimer

Premix ORM is a research prototype (alpha).
This codebase is an AI-assisted research prototype and should be treated as experimental.

It is provided for experimentation and evaluation only. APIs may change without
notice, data migrations are not guaranteed to be stable, and production use is
not recommended at this time.

Key gaps for production:
- Safety guards for destructive operations are not fully implemented.
- Sensitive data masking in logs is not implemented.
- Automatic pool tuning and metrics are still planned.
