## Core Philosophy Checklist

This document tracks how the current implementation maps to the five pillars.

### 1) Zero-Overhead Abstraction
- Status: Partial
- Evidence: Model SQL is generated by macros and executed via `sqlx`.
- Gaps: Query SQL strings are assembled at runtime (not fully compile-time).
- Planned: Smart configuration auto-tunes pool settings for the target environment.
- References: `premix-orm/premix-macros/src/lib.rs`, `premix-orm/premix-core/src/lib.rs`

### 2) Mental Model Match
- Status: Implemented (with planned DX upgrades)
- Evidence: Active Record style APIs and automatic table naming.
- Planned: Transactional test utilities and a MockDatabase helper.
- References: `premix-orm/premix-core/src/lib.rs`, `premix-orm/premix-macros/src/lib.rs`

### 3) Impossible-to-Fail Safety
- Status: Partial
- Evidence: Derive macros enforce model structure and column generation.
- Gaps: String-based filters can still fail at runtime.
- Planned: Destructive guards for bulk deletes without filters.
- References: `premix-orm/premix-core/src/lib.rs`, `premix-orm/premix-macros/src/lib.rs`

### 4) Glass Box Transparency
- Status: Implemented (with planned masking)
- Evidence: `to_sql()`, `to_update_sql()`, and `to_delete_sql()` expose generated SQL.
- Planned: `#[premix(sensitive)]` to mask PII in logs.
- References: `premix-orm/premix-core/src/lib.rs`

### 5) Graceful Escape Hatch
- Status: Implemented (with planned extensions)
- Evidence: `Model::raw_sql(...)` allows raw SQL while preserving model mapping.
- Planned: Arbitrary struct mapping (`fetch_as::<ReportStruct>()`) for reporting queries.
- References: `premix-orm/premix-core/src/lib.rs`
