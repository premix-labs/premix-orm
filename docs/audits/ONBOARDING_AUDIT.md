# ONBOARDING AUDIT

Status: Partial (doc tests, mdBook build, and basic example run executed).

Friction Log:
- Doc tests ran successfully; one doc test is ignored by design.
- mdBook build succeeded (`mdbook build orm-book`).
- examples/basic-app ran successfully and printed expected output.

Content Gaps:
- Docs include limitations and performance tuning sections. Verify first example runs end-to-end with DB config.

Stop Conditions:
- No full "Getting Started" walkthrough executed; no runtime example execution with DB.
